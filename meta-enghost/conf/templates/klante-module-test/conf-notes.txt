This is the configuration I used to test on klante-module.

The recipes to note are:
- enghost-image: A kernel/devicetree/rootfs fitImage for use with u-boot.
- xilinx-bootbin: boot.bin and boot.scr for use with u-boot


Build these recipes and place boot.bin, boot.scr, and fitImage on SD card.
fitImage must be renamed to image.ub because that's what the boot script looks
for.

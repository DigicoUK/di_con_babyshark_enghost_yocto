* Digico engine comms

Required properties:
  - compatible         : Should be "digico,yeng"
  - reg                : Contains memory mapped axi io's location and length.
  - interrupt-parent   : The parent interrupt controller
  - interrupts         : The single interrupt description (format dependent on interrupt controller)
  - clocks             : Should contain a single clock definition

Example:
    yeng: yeng@50000000 {
        compatible = "digico,yeng";
        status = "ok";
        reg = <0x50000000 0x1000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
        interrupts = <0 56 1>;
        clocks = <&clkc 15>;
    };
